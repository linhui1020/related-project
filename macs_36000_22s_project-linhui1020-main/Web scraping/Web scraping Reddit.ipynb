       " 'Well, Captain America\\'s Shield was commissioned by the US Government, he declined all of the final models that Stark came up for him and selected the one that was still a prototype. If you remember the scene there were half a dozen or so finished models, and the Vibranium one. Cap actually asks why that one wasn\\'t mass produced and was told it was all of the Vibranium they had.\\n\\nI would conject that between the fact that so many shields were ready *and* there was the question of why it wasn\\'t standard issue, the shield was ordered not specifically for Captain America (or even the Super Soldier Program) but for all US infantrymen. Why they declined to use any of Stark\\'s designs is up for debate (but I would assume a cost/weight issue making mass production unfeasible for line troops in the field). \\n\\nWhat is key is that the entire production line was not accepted by the US Government. We don\\'t see any other soldier in the US army using shields, and no later troops using a more advanced form. The entire project was scrapped.\\n\\nUsually the prototypes of contracts remain the property of the company that built them, unless they are handed over to the Armed Forces for testing. Usually testing models are produced and *those* handed over, but the original designs stay with the Company. So since these were likely the original prototypes and the US Government declined to accept them for testing or general production, it\\'s probable that Stark requested them back from testing as they held proprietary Stark Technology and  Research.\\n\\nThis is actually supported by Iron Man 2, where we see a shield prototype in Stark\\'s workshop (where he uses it as a prop to hold up a device).  It also shows up in the background of his workshop in Iron Man 1 in a brief sequence. Since at least one prototype was sent back, it\\'s probable that all of them were. So the various properties were returned to Stark Industries.\\n\\nHowever the Shield used, the Vibranium might be a different story. It was chosen by Steve to be part of his kit and kept with him through the pint he was Frozen. One could argue that that Prototype (it was still not a production model) was acquired by the Military for the use of Captain America. At the time though it was still a  Prototype and unless the contract was purchased, it should revert to Stark Industries after the war.\\n\\nHowever, I\\'d argue that it actually belongs to Steve since Stark was technically \"loaning\" the Shield to him as a favor: after all the Infantry Shield program was cancelled or rejected. Further the Loan became permanent after Stark died and Steve retained control for those years under the ice. On waking, he reassumed control of the Shield, costume, and identity of Captain America despite not actually being in the Army any more, with no objections (even to the point of serving on the Non-Military Shield Intelligence Agency). At that point any claims to ownership should have passed, any claims to salvage should revert to the \"survivor\" of the salvage, and Steve has the right to gift it to anyone.\\n\\nEven more so after Tony took it back at the end of Civil War and later gave it back during the events of the Infinity War and the Aftermath. **However** this shield was then broken in half by Thanos during the Battle of Earth. The Shield he gave to Sam was an Alternate Shield from the 1940\\'s when he went back in time to live with Peggy. How he acquired that one is a mystery since that timeline\\'s shield ought to be frozen in Ice with him (or if it was the Post Battle of Earth for that Universe, it should have also been broken or that Universe\\'s Thawed-Steve not 616 Visiting Peggy Steve\\'s.\\n\\nRegardless, he gave that Shield to Sam, who eventually donated it to the Smithsonian. The Dept. of Defense took it and gave it to Captain America II, but this was an illegal action. Items given to the Smithsonian are to be kept and protected for the good of the American People. Unless it was for an ethical return to the culture that originally owned the time, the Smithsonian does not let people or Government Agencies take it. So the transfer to Cap America II was not technically legal, and it should still belong to the Smithsonian. Sam *could* make a request to take it back, but it\\'s not 100% sure they would do so if the item was deemed to have strong cultural significance for the American People.',\n",

He was put on ice and years later was revived by either aim or Hydra and he fought Cap. Protocide was significantly stronger than Cap, so there seems to be some variance to it.\\n\\nBut you should also take into consideration that there are numerous other ways that people have become stronger than Cap. The Power Broker (specifically the comics version vs the MCU) was able to augment numerous individuals beyond Steve's physical capacity. It wasn't exactly an easy process, but he was able to do it dozens of times. And something like an iron man suit, or even knockoffs such as titanium man, crimson's dynamo, or guardsman armor, are able to augment strength to levels significant higher than Steve.\\n\\nThe real problem with recreating the super soldier serum is that people want to recreate Captain America. But what makes Captain America who he is isn't the strength, but the courage and determination that Steve brings. That's the hard part to recreate.\\n\\nAs far as giving the serum to non-humans, it might work to varying degrees.

Similar to terrorist cells acting under national or religious radicalism, their actions darken the perception of the entire group, regardless of whether or not the majority of mutants denounce their actions\\n3.\\t\\u2060One of said mutant groups was lead by a man (magneto) who now works with the X-men. It’s hard to take the X-men’s message of peace and coexistence seriously when the guy responsible for all the plans that both the Brotherhood of mutants and the Acolytes committed is now working with them. Ditto with Emma Frost. She was a high level leader of the hellfire club and she’s now LITERALLY in bed with the leader of the Xmen.\\n4.\\t\\u2060Mutants are a convenient scapegoat for ambitious politicians who want to enact draconian laws. Prior to civil war, it was hard to make any legislation controlling super heroes. The public support of them was too high. The average joe likes the avengers and the fantastic four. Any politician who went after Captain America was committing career suicide. But this wasn’t true with mutants. Mutants are a general group with a very clear baseline establishing who’s on and who’s out. Plus majority of them aren’t heroes and some of them are actually villains so going after them and rallying voters against them is much more expedient\\n5.\\t\\u2060At the end of the day, the X-men aren’t all that great in assimilating mutants with the rest of the world.

One of their core members was on multiple occasions possessed by a psychotic cosmic entity that eats stars.

       " 'This is a tricky one to answer, because it’s an inherently Doylist question, or at least it seems like one at first. Batman’s ‘superpower’ is the same as Superman’s; he has the benefit of the doubt. If Superman can overcome an obstacle by detecting something with his super-senses or performing a mundane task really fast, we assume he can do that. Likewise, if it’s reasonable for Batman to whip out a handheld device from his belt or happen to know some factoid that allows him to resolve an issue, we assume he can do that too. It’s why they’re such an effective team; they’re essentially the same hero with very different perspectives. \\n\\nEven though it’s technically Doylist thinking, that perspective is necessary to answer this question from a Watsonian perspective, too. The answer is this: Batman can hit as far above his weight class as is possible given what he would memorize in his spare time or carry in his belt based on what he usually fights. And given that paranoia is a lifestyle for this guy, that gives him a lot of coverage. \\n\\nFor example, if Batman winds up fighting a single enemy on the level of Bane, with an unknown physiology and no known motive for attacking him, he would probably retreat. But if he was attacked by an unknown kryptonian? He’s been carrying kryptonite in his belt since the League was formed. He could fold a no-name kryptonian civilian like a cheap tee shirt. Is that prep work? I wouldn’t say so; he had no idea that he was going to be fighting a kryptonian today. You might just as well say that he’s doing prep work by wearing a costume or learning martial arts and therefore /can’t/ fight an opponent unprepared. \\n\\nSo what level does that put him on? He could lose a fight against a street-level unknown with bootleg powers, but he could beat a kryptonian or daxamite out of hand because he probably doesn’t take a dump without a sample of their lethal weakness handy. If he has access to it, he would probably carry a radion batarang, ‘just in case’. So is his level simultaneously below the theoretical Bane rip-off and also above Darkseid? I don’t think so. \\n\\nThe Watsonian answer to your question, essentially, is that his skill at stepping outside of the usual power scaling ladder of heavy hitters in the universe is what makes Batman such an effective asset to the League. His life depends on his ability to very quickly uncover how to defeat people he could never possibly win a fistfight against, and he carries gear that gives him the widest possible coverage when it comes to doing that. He’s the one member of the League who is least reasonable to try to powerscale. \\n\\nTo answer the question in the spirit it was intended, though, I can think of an example of him facing a superhuman opponent who he states explicitly would be very close to his level in terms of CQC and could probably beat him, given enough time: Captain America, in the JLA/Avengers crossover. If we remove gear and terrain advantages and everything else and put him up against an opponent with no exploitable weaknesses, then I guess that’s about as far as he could go. A peak-human with flawless CQC skills and a legendary tactical mind. Which also describes Batman himself, so the point seems kind of moot.',\n",

Iron Man is rich and uses his wealth to enhance his superhero privilege.  Thor is a has Asgard backing him up. Captain America and Black Widow work for the US government and/or SHIELD (usually), so they have privileged status.  Other Marvel heroes with superhero privilege include the Fantastic Four (government), Captain Marvel (government), Moon Knight (wealth), and almost everyone who's a member of a team or racial group, such as mutants or inhumans.\\n\\nWhen you have superhero privilege, you do not have to worry about supervillains finding your secret identity and going after your loved ones or otherwise ruining your life.  Your civilian life is protected against that kind of thing, or at least if someone does go after you a team of government agents/Avengers/Mutants/Inhumans will respond against that supervillain.  (Of course, in the case of Mutants and Inhumans their response can often land you in worse trouble with the public or the government.  Those groups have a more limited form of privilege.)  If you have privilege because of wealth, then often there's nothing a supervillain can do to you that you can't write a check to fix.  The biggest threat to your civilian life is supervillains going after loved ones -- which is why you then buy armor and weapons for those loved ones so they can defend themselves, as Tony Stark did for Pepper Potts/Rescue.\\n\\nIf you do not have superhero privilege, you need to keep your identity secret and/or stay hidden from the authorities at all times.  Marvel superheroes without privilege include Spider-Man, the Punisher, Ms Marvel, and Daredevil.  Often they get temporary privilege when they join teams like the Avengers, but they know it's a temporary gig so they don't reveal their identities easily.\\n\\nSome superheroes really, really need privilege but don't have it.

Even the Western comic characters that came after Superman and Batman (heroes who don’t want to kill) seem to have a high body count. The WWII heroes, including Captain America, would also have high counts. The superheroes and vigilante heroes, however, written to rarely kill, often wouldn’t and relied on the system to punish the criminals. In the end, as violent as Bruce is, he can’t routinely kill his enemies, and that has to be because he saw his parents killed in front of him.\\n\\nTwo is the government: whether city, county, state, or federal, they all seem to be corrupt. On the other hand, however, they don’t appear to have the necessary resources to fund large police forces, penitentiary systems, or psychiatric hospitals. Because these workers aren’t paid well or even moderately, it’s not a surprise they need extra income to support themselves and their families, and turn to the highest bidder. These structural issues look to be the outcome of widespread conservative small government thinking, at all levels of government, resulting in few jails and fewer asylums, fewer staff at the few locations that do exist, and few police.\\n\\nThree: Batman, Superman, and anyone else who is successful at rounding up the criminals are very quickly victims of their own success: there are not enough cells to lock everyone up, so many are released or escape very fast and are soon back in the streets committing crimes again, so the heroes defeat them and they go back to jail, only to be released very quickly…again.\\n\\nFourth: in addition to criminal gangs and Mafia-type organizations, the heroes are fighting corrupt businessmen, mad scientists, and political organizations that are all corrupt. So one group goes down, but just like Hydra, two more groups start up.\\n\\nFifth: Fascist and communist groups are also at large and engaging in disruptive actions—-not just actual Soviet or German spies, but sympathizers wanting to overthrow all governments.\\n\\nSixth: because of economic issues (especially the Depression), people can’t find work and the ranks of these groups that our heroes go up against are constantly swollen as those people join up, adding to the problems.\\n\\nSeventh: Yes, the rise of heroic vigilantes does lead to the rise of super criminals and especially super villains.\\n\\nIt’s a wonder that America survived; without the aid of WWII, it’s within the realm of possibility that America might have collapsed by 1945.',\n",

Why this matters is that it wasn't even a hit just him pushing off to fly destroyed the planet. Can can causally beat down green lanterns who could fight some of the lesser new gods causally.\\n\\nThe problem is that specific issue tried to hard balance characters against each other(they did massively piss poor) an example is that they had captain America go hard blows against batman. This is a cap who was able take punches from spiderman and hurt a fully armored iron man with a punch. Was going blow to blow with a normal dude. So either captain America was now normal human level(as massive nerf) or batman was now superhuman level to quite a high degree(massively buffing batman). And they were just about equal. Which doesn't make sense.\\n\\nThor beat captain marvel because um reasons he turned him back to billy batson(somthing ONLY the wizard shazam could do)  and then stopped him from rechanging by intersecting the lightning because it was lightning despite the comics saying it wasn't real lightning that it as a magical bolt it appears as lightning because of the speed.\\n\\nWolverine beat Lobo. The main man who can 1v1 superman and win. Wiped his entire planet out for fun. Pissed of heaven and hell so much they bar his commission and beat darkseid in a fist fight, held up a planet with no problems. And a regeneration factor just as good as wolverine's in not better only because adamantium poisoning. And he was beaten by wolverine.\\n\\nStorm beat wonder woman. The daughter of zues.  With near immunity to non magic lightning who had just beaten thor. And she was beaten by storm. She is a superman level person capable of fighting him as a near equal.\\n\\nBalance in the entire comic line was so wack it's not even funny. Considering the in the second fusion comic sentry considered superman his equal. A sentry who used the void to fight superamn thought he was an equal. Now mind you a far weaker sentry fought a near WWH to a standstill until he used void and hurt hulk so badly that even though his regeneration took him days to heal from.\\n\\nNow it was also stated that characters won entirely based on popularity which drew criticism from both fans and writers alike instead of their pairings they wanted.\\n\\nThis matters because Pre crisis superman isn't even the strongest version of that canon super man that would be his Crisis Form which he used against the antimoniter and superboy prime.

Even when he was stripped of his powers, Thor was still amazingly resilient due to his dense body, withstanding being hit by a van with ease, and only being seemingly killed by a punch from the Destroyer. When he is at full power and armed with Mjølnir, Thor possesses nigh-invulnerability, including high resistance to powerful energy blasts, immense blunt force trauma, falls from great heights, explosions and various other opposing forces. He was unharmed and unaffected by the vacuum of space for indefinite periods of time unaided. Thor withstood high caliber bullets from the Quinjet that was flown by Ultron, who attempt on killing him during the fight at Sokovia without any injury. He withstood the extreme cold of Jotunheim, the extreme heat of Muspelheim, survived a direct near point-blank range blast from Gungnir blasting him out of Odin\\'s chamber, and falling several hundred feet to the ground, showing no visible signs of injury. Thor easily withstood a four hundred percent-charged repulsor blast from Iron Man, was barely affected and completely uninjured by Quicksilver smashing into him at extreme speeds, took a mighty punch from Hulk with only a minor nosebleed, and even withstood the full force of the Destroyer\\'s energy blasts with no visible injury. During his final battle with Malekith, Thor was even able to survive being hit by quite a few tendrils of the Aether Infinity Stone energy, and later a blast of Surtur\\'s Twilight Sword flames without any permanent damage, though it should be noted that Thor had not been facing off against Surtur while the latter was at full power. Whenever he is injured, Thor\\'s physique allows him to shrug off minor injuries such as small stab wounds from Asgardian blades or allows him to withstand a direct blow in the face from a massive Frost Giant and laugh afterwards. He resisted the direct destruction of the city of Novi Grad followed by a one-kilometer drop in the sea and was only momentarily unconscious. However, his durability would not prevent equally or even stronger foes like Hulk, Kurse, Ultron, weakened Surtur, Hela, or Thanos from wounding him. Nevertheless, Thor\\'s own durability could still allow him to withstand their strength and power for quite some time before he starts to drop in power and be injured, as he withstood a severe beating from Kurse, Ultron, and Hela, notably surviving being stabbed with her Necroswords, which easily killed not only the Einherjar with a single hit but also the Warriors Three and the Valkyries, who had greater durability than low-tier Asgardian warriors, with no permanent damage, and managed to continue fighting afterwards, overpowered Surtur despite Surtur being at least equal, if not superior, to Thor in power, withstood a repeated tossing to the ground from Hulk during the Contest of Champions with no damage whereas Loki, despite his own extreme resilience, was completely wiped out from such an attack, and he was able to remain conscious upon being overpowered and pummelled by the angered Hulk long enough for him to experience a vision from Odin and turn the tides while sustaining no injury. After getting his full powers, Thor\\'s durability grew much greater, with him thus shrugging off Hela\\'s attacks and continuing to fight her with no deterioration in his performance and even managing to remain conscious after having been badly beaten by Thanos to an even greater degree than Hulk was, which still soundly knocked out the gamma beast, and even survived having his head squeezed by Thanos, whereas Loki was quickly killed by Thanos with less effort, once again proving he is significantly more durable and resilient than Loki, and soon be exposed to the vacuum of space, although all this combined caused him to pass out. Thor was also capable of surviving the full force of a re-ignited Nidavellir star for several minutes, though it left his body severely charred and rendered him unconscious, leaving him to death without the power of Stormbreaker. Thor\\'s physical constitution is so strong he is able to survive exposure to the power of the Infinity Stones, as evidenced when he was able to quickly recover from being hit by the Reality Stone\\'s powers whenever Malekith blasts it at him. He was also able to remain conscious after repeatedly being pressed by the force of the Power Stone against his head, however, at a less degree of the stone\\'s full power whereas beings less powerful were instantly obliterate by the Stone, although he nevertheless suffered excruciating pain every time Thanos pressed it against him and prolonged exposure would likely eventually kill him, as Loki quickly submitted to Thanos\\' demands when he saw Thor being tortured by the Power Stone. Even while hampered by his poor lifestyle and subsequent weight gain, he was still far more durable than most of the other Avengers, as he was able to withstand getting pummeled by the 2014 Thanos\\' strongest attacks while remaining conscious, as well as enduring Thanos using Stormbreaker to nearly gut open his chest long enough for Captain America to save him with only minor bruises and bleeding scars.”\\n\\n\\nHe’s strong, very, very, very strong.\\n\\nHe’s still stronger then any human even when he’s fat.\\n\\nYes it’s true that Fat Thor is the strongest he’s ever been as stated by word of god.\\n\\nBut I reconcile that with mental and emotional strength because he’s the reason Thanos succeeded with the snap.\\n\\nThor wanted vengeance not justice.\\n\\nJustice would have been killing Thanos in the most effective manner in the most efficient way possible not being clouded by emotions.\\n\\nThor on his mission of vengeance wanted to kill Thanos and have Thanos be incredible pain long enough to see Thor bury the axe in his chest to know that it was Thor that did it.\\n\\nSo that’s why he’s so broken because it was his want and need to see Thanos in pain that cost the universe 50% of everyone and he hates himself because he feels responsible because he was.\\n\\nIt’s only when he gets his pep talk from his mother’s variant that he begins to forgive himself thus making him the strongest he’s ever been.',\n",

Being part of the police also means that you would be beholden to any hijacking of the police force. What would you do if you were preferred to look the other way on an atrocity, or even by complicit in it?\\n\\nBatman works as a consulting detective for the police, so he comes pretty close to the police himself.

They may have a superhuman programme you can consider signing up for, or you can just join as a recruit. \\n\\nYou could also look into any associations like the justice league, SHIELD, or Xavier's school for the gifted, and see if they are willing to accept a new recruit.

       " 'Love this question.\\n\\nI remember there being at least one version of President Lex Luthor having a government-employed squad of super powered people for a time. It included Captain Atom, Major Force and Power Girl, I believe.\\n\\nThe Justice League/Justice Society are both also sometimes an official part of the American, world-wide or universe-wide security/law enforcement - with payment and all. The DCAU version especially has a ton of employees both powered and not.\\n\\nIn many versions of Marvel\\'s earth there\\'s also S.H.I.E.L.D. and its various companion-forces (STRIKE, SWORD, etc.) - all government special forces that deal with specific threats. They often get called in when the police or other law enforcement can\\'t handle a particular threat, especially if said threat is powered, alien and/or has especially good tech.\\n\\nCaptain America and Captain Carter were also both official parts of the US Army before being removed from their time.\\n\\nYour powers in particular would be great for not just law enforcement, but also scientific stuff, construction, all types of things. There\\'s no reason for you not to join the police (though you may be recommended for a more specialized unit), S.W.A.T., etc. if they let you, but joining the Justice League, S.H.I.E.L.D. or a similar group may offer better opportunities if you\\'re up for it.\\n\\n*Keep in mind though* - if you\\'re on a Marvel Earth, chances are that you would be considered a mutant, since it sounds like your powers more or less just manifested. In that case, you may want to stay undercover or change up your story to include some wacky incident, since there are absolutely groups and entire governments out to hunt mutants in a lot of Marvel universes.\\n\\nTo more specifically answer your questions:\\n\\n&gt; Could I become a cop in either marvel or DC\\n\\nIn the main versions, absolutely. Not hiding your powers will have some effects (ranging anywhere from odd looks to racist hatred depending on where you go and whether you\\'re considered a mutant), but overall you\\'ll probably be fine. Expect an unusual amount of super villain cases, however.\\n\\n&gt; Is there any precedent for a powered cop?\\n\\nOh absolutely! Some examples:\\n\\n- at least one Flash works as a crime scene investigator for his local police department\\n\\n- Bishop, one of the more powerful X-Men mutants, worked as a cop in a special mutant district of New York for a while\\n\\n- Jim \"The Guardian\" Harper is both a beat cop and superhero\\n\\n- while not Marvel or DC, in the Judge Dredd universe there is a whole division of Judges with super powers - Judges basically being a mix of cop, judge, jury and executioner (the most famous example being Psi-Judge Cassandra Anderson, Dredd\\'s partner)\\n\\n- the superhero (supercop?) Dragon and his son Malcolm Dragon both serve(d) the Chicago Police Department for a long time, with the former also temporarily being part of a government superhero team\\n\\n- while I\\'m not sure they count, both Hawkgirl and Hawkman were (at least in the Silver Age comics) apparently part of Thanagar\\'s Hawk-police force and sent to Earth to study Earth police techniques while fighting crime before eventually joining the Justice League\\n\\nKeep in mind that out of all these, I\\'m pretty sure only Dragon, his son, Bishop and Hawkman and Hawkgirl actively and openly used their powers during their police work. It does however create a precedent of cops having and using powers in both Marvel, DC and other multiverses.\\n\\n&gt; If not a cop specifically. is there precedent for or laws regulating using my powers in my career?\\n\\nPossibly! It\\'s highly dependent on the universe, country and timeline you find yourself in. For example, the MCU\\'s Sokovia Accords forbid any super powered individual to use their powers in fighting crime or other threats without the government\\'s explicit permission, if I remember right, which may at the very least make it more difficult for you to join some careers - chances are they\\'ll push you to becoming an Avenger. There may very well also be laws against mutants joining certain careers or getting jobs at all.\\n\\n&gt; Any other career recommendations for someone with my skillset\\n\\nConstruction.

Back To the Future (I\\'m pretty sure that crossed over with Spidey once, who also has saved people\\'s Hostess fruit pies in yet another universe). This universe, ours. Within each universe there\\'s all manner of local stuff with local rules like other dimensions, pocket dimensions, different sorts of timelines, and so on. \\n* Multiverse: this is where we\\'re still in the scope of the \"universe\" I just mentioned. The dead easiest examples would be DC\\'s Crisis On Infinite Earths, Marvel\\'s endless numbered universes, and Star Trek episode \"Parallels\" where Worf randomly jumps universe to universe, until finally literally hundreds of thousands of Enterprises start converging in *one* universe.

Some sorts of Cosmic Things happen, and temporarily, they get to meet. \\n\\nThis is the ONLY time you can really broach this fully \"in universe\" -- sometimes, the meeting parties recall what happened.

       " 'Earth is unique because of it\\'s disparity.\\n\\nLet\\'s unfairly and arbitrarily quantitate the \"level\" of an average human as a 3.  I\\'m a 3, you\\'re a 3, 99.999% of the earth is a 3.  Now on Xandar (pre-Thanos), everyone might be a 6 - advanced tech, cybernetics, etc.  And on Asgard, everyone is like an 11 at least.  You\\'ve got superhumans making casual chit-chat down at the pub before going back to their dull job.\\n\\nThis manifests in two slight issues:\\n\\n* \"If everyone is special, no one is\" - Syndrome\\'s point echoes a bit here, with the general lack of stand-out Asgardians being a prime selling point.  With no pride taken in their own strength unless it is specifically drawn out of them (Thor\\'s royal lineage, the explicit training of the Valkyries, etc), most simply accept their position and don\\'t appear to consider their power \"important\" to the universe at large.\\n* \"Equally Matched Aggression Level\" - Stealing a page from the Venture Bros, you match knives with knives and laser guns with laser guns.  Sure, if a Xandarian steals from your shop and then jets off in their high tech boots, it\\'s a problem... until the Xandarian police enter chase with their own flying vehicles, and use electronets to subdue the criminal.  The availability of power makes the chase to have a unique greater power feel unrealistic (outside of the scope of, say, an Infinity Stone).\\n\\nBut Earth has just the right conditions to breed superheroes en masse.\\n\\n* Inequality is rampant.  Living in it ignites a deep drive to escape it, and witnessing it imbues the watcher with a desire to fix it.  Both of these drive people to go beyond their \"lot in life\" in new and brilliant ways.\\n* Earth is *abundant* in unique and powerful materials.  A vibranium meteorite being the centerpiece of it all, we also have the right elements and tools in our possession already to create infinite energy reactors and pseudosentient nanobot-level technology.  Not every backwater planet is going to have those levels of resources, regardless of how much the average 3 year old can lift.\\n* Earth has some unexplainable quality to it that makes it a great interest to foreign planets, having been visited and toyed with for thousands of years by beings of higher power.  This gives us a perpetual shared history of being placed in the corner, and fighting to overcome it.\\n\\nWhat this does is creates an ecosystem where when there is that special human - the one who wants to achieve more, break out of everyday life and excel, become better than anyone else - they go *hard*.  Tony Stark did not go from a 3 to 5, he went from a 3 to a 15.  Dr. Strange was not satisfied learning the magic to heal his hands, he had to learn more, until he was the most potent sorcerer in existence.  \\n\\nWhile there is obviously growth among non-humans, this intense drive to grow is not demonstrably a universal quality; something within it, or at least how it manifests, is unique to humans, whether via genetics or the environment we exist in.  Almost every earth-born superhero shows this same incredible gap, going from the average human level to something that rivals powerful cosmic entities.\\n\\nBeyond that, I want to make special note of Steve Rogers, aka Captain America.  He, of course, is not exactly a natural route of human growth; yet, his creation in and of itself is a metanarrative about humanity\\'s never ending mission to improve itself.  And yet even he demonstrates the terrifying power of humans in an interesting way.  \\n\\nThe serum he was injected with \"works\" by all accounts we have seen.  It amplifies the natural qualities of its recipient, maximizing their physical attributes to the \"peak\" of human physique, and tuning our minds to match, magnifying the good and the bad all the same.  We see its effect on many unique individuals, and each has different ways it affects them - but the one consistent trait is that they all *continue to grow stronger*.  The \"peak\" form continues to become a higher and higher bar.  That trait is not one that any single subject of the serum presents, but rather a unifying trait across humanity.  We keep growing.\\n\\nPerhaps that\\'s why humans die so young compared to the other races, our biology itself growing more rapidly and burning out.  Maybe it\\'s why we value our fragile existence that much more, enough that we become protectors of others without a second thought.  It is absolutely why we have been able to persist so long, amongst a universe filled to the brim with monsters, ancient demigods, and magic rocks that all seem to a find way onto our home turf.  We see our next hurdle, and we grow to match it.\\n\\nWe don\\'t stop at just enough.  Humans aren\\'t satisfied becoming just a bit better, once they see the possibilities before them.  Thousands of years ago, we hunted animals by wearing them down, demonstrating that while they may outspeed us, or overpower us directly, we will keep striving, keep improving, and keep trying until eventually, we bring home the prize.  The stakes of the game may have changed in the modern era, but humanity hasn\\'t.\\n\\nThor brought up the assault on Xandar as if it was taken with barely any resistance.  Despite their advancements and \"higher average\", they couldn\\'t produce anything that Thanos couldn\\'t rip through, even without a single infinity stone in his possession.  Earth mounted both a defense and an offense, minimized its initial losses, and when that still wasn\\'t enough, engineered and executed a plan to reverse the damage done *to the entire Universe*, because simply getting revenge wasn\\'t enough for us.\\n\\nSo yea, your average alien can probably dirtslam the average human without breaking their stride.

The helicopter we see in the movie looks like it\\'s probably based on the Airbus AS350 B2, which has a maximum lifting capacity with an external load of 5,512 lbs. The helicopter itself weighs 2,690 lbs. Which means it should be able to exert a force equal to roughly 2,822 lbs. So for Cap to be able to pull that helicopter back down towards the ground, he had to be exerting more than 2,822 lbs of force in the form of what was essentially a bicep curl.\\n(If someone out there has a better grasp of how to do that math and I got something wrong, forgive me. I just had to make educated guesses based on how much Airbus says their helicopter can lift).\\n\\nThe current bicep curl world record is 249 lbs.\\n\\nThat means that Cap is able to exert over 11 times as much force as a real-world world record holder. For both that statement, and \"Cap is peak human, but not superhuman\" to be true at the same time, the only possible conclusion that maintains any level of in-universe consistency has to be \"humans in this universe are significantly stronger than humans in our universe.\" Or at the very least, the maximum level of strength that they\\'re able to reach is significantly higher. \\n\\nI prefer to think of it as their base durability is higher across the board, while their maximum strength still requires significant effort to get above what we see as \"normal\". That explains why random street thugs can be knocked out by superheroes regularly without permanent damage.

If Superman\\'s only actions are saving people from a flood and the dictator gets all pissing, the U.S. could easily ignore it and not lose any diplomacy points with other nations.',\n",

Metropolis is just his main-city, what with him living and working there.\\n\\nFlash is kind of a dumbass at times, but he also regularly travels across the planet - be it to get something or show off - and probably also stops crime at times when doing this. He still sticks to Central City because 1) he\\'s a paraded hero there and 2) he lives and works there in his civilian identity.\\n\\nMost superheroes also simply don\\'t have the means to constantly travel across the globe to a different country, 3rd world or otherwise, and thus stick to their home country or city.\\n\\nAnother factor is that many superheroes operate on a sort of \"turf\" system, especially in the DC multiverse. Heroes consider whatever city they operate out of to be their own territory, which is somewhat off-limits to other superheroes with other territories. Sometimes this has more understandable reasons (like Black Panther and Wakanda), sometimes it\\'s just for ego reasons (Batman and Gotham) but usually it\\'s just a kind of automatic understanding.\\n\\nBatman is often seen giving out to other League members for operating in Gotham, for example - it\\'s not unreasonable to think that 3rd world countries/cities have their own heroes doing work. You just hear about them less, because the news about heroes tends to either be America-focused (since a majority of superheroes seems to either come from or operate in the US) or just a complete global thing.\\n\\nAn example: Besides Captain America there\\'s also a Captain Canada, a Captain Britain and a Hauptmann Deutschland (basically Captain Germany). All of these guys exist, all of them are superheroes to some degree, but you hear about them a lot less than about Captain America because they have their own non-US country - their own turf/territory - in which they operate, which tends not to overlap with the news of the Avengers, Justice League or X-Men.\\n\\nSome 3rd world countries, especially in these universes, are also (partially) governed by less-than-good groups or dictators, and heroes coming in to try and stop that often doesn\\'t have good consequences. It\\'s also how things like the Sokovia accords happen, especially if something goes wrong and the heroes in question don\\'t work as close with the government as the government would like.',\n",

There is one earlier hero who is absolutely essential to this though - Captain America. Captain America was created to fight espionage in the US during WWII and was given a flashy outfit as part of nationalistic propaganda. He then got iced and there were no superheroes for a bit. \\n\\nCut to the Fantastic Four’s flight to space and transformation. Reed would have been ok just continuing to live his life, Johnny and Sue would too. But Ben was turned into a giant rock-monster and would not be accepted in society. Reed Richards then hatched a plan to let Ben continue to live a normal-ish life. Recalling the public reception to Captain America, Reed made flashy outfits and a cute name “the Fantastic Four” and made sure they were very publicly engaging in heroics. This let Ben become a popular superhero instead of an outcast monster. Their costumed heroics, specifically their first battle with the Mole Man, started the Age of Marvels. \\n\\nThis inspired later heroes like Peter Parker to put on a costume and fight crime. When Tony Stark’s heart nearly failed he didn’t just build a chest piece for his own survival, he turned into Iron Man. Hank Pym used his tech to turn himself and his girlfriend into costumed heroes. Professor Xavier copied Reed’s plan and made the X-Men public costumed heroes to garner support. \\n\\nSome heroes would still come into existence without Reed’s Fantastic Four plan. Bruce Banner would still have turned into the Hulk. Thor would have still come to Earth and battled evil. Xavier would still do whatever was necessary to stop Magneto. Dr. Doom would still have put on the iron mask and plotted to conquer the world. \\n\\nBut the general idea of costumed heroes publicly battling evil was indeed initiated by Reed Richards trying to copy an American propaganda tactic to make life bearable for his mutated friend.',\n",

The power broker regularly creates people stronger than Steve, some examples being John Walker, Lemar Hoskins, and Dennis Dunphy. But none of these guys inspire people the way Steve Rogers did. So even though these people are more powerful than Steve it\\'s viewed as not being the true successor to project rebirth. (Also, power brokers methods sometimes resulted in death, which is another problem. But since Steve was the only recipient of the serum we have no way of knowing if it had a similar mortality rate in which Steve just got lucky.)\\n\\nYou don\\'t even need to improve the physical body to make something better than Captain America. Something like iron man\\'s suit or Pym particles will make someone that\\'s physically superior to Cap. These or similar methods have even been used in military scenarios, so it\\'s not like they lack the capacity to do it.\\n\\nBut the real problem comes down to personalities. Steve is practically a perfect person, willing to do the right thing regardless of what it means for him or the mission. But that\\'s precisely the type of person these organizations don\\'t want. They want someone who follows orders and is willing to do their dirty work. And when they give that type of person power it always goes poorly. Then their subject has to be taken down by someone like Cap, and the failure is chalked up to \"imperfect replication of the serum\" when that wasn\\'t the actual problem. Even if you had a perfect recreation of the original serum it would still go poorly if given to a person that wasn\\'t ready for that kind of power.\\n\\nSuper powers are a dime a dozen, but Steven Rogers is one of a kind.',\n",

Since most of those who take it are seeking power, it gives them power, but usually at a cost.

While Steve's great PR, he is actually pretty bad at following orders. Captain America is a hero before he's a soldier, and most military experimentation later on, such as Nuke or Wolverine, included a crapton of specialized conditioning in an attempt to make  soldier who was better at eliminating targets and following orders. From a military perspective, black widow was the better use of resources.\",\n",

The Hulk not needing to sleep may explain why he was quite so effective on Sakaar, though.\\n\\nCaptain America, despite being superhuman by our standards today, is only peak human. He may not suffer from the effects of sleep deprivation as easily, but he almost certainly needs some form of sleep sooner or later. If he uses the micronap system we know some of the other heroes, like Tony Stark, use, he could very well be asleep, and you'd not even be aware of it.\\n\\nSpider-Man has superhuman stamina, but he still needs to sleep at the end of the day.

       " 'Here\\'s my outline. There are a few constraints I set for myself here\\n\\n1. The DOD owns the rights to Captain America. Therefore, there is a vested interest in making him look really really good\\n\\n2. The DOD is using this as a exercise to inspire ordinary people. As such, the inspiring nature of Rogers is emphasized. \\n\\n\\nThere is an issue that I\\'m sure I can workshop: The lack of Carter in Act I. Need to give her a song, but I\\'m not sure where to stick it. I\\'m not sure if throwing in a love story would work with the rest of the story I\\'m trying to pitch here. Anyways, my outline:\\n\\n---\\n\\n#ACT I: The First\\n\\nWe start with a prologue **(The Dream)** and are then introduced us to Red Skull and HYDRA **(Tentacles Around the World)** before seeing Steve as a kid with Bucky in New York, where we go through songs introducing Steve **(I Can Do This All Day)** and Bucky **(Farwell, Bucky)**, get introduced to Howard Stark, Carter, and Erskine at the Stark Expo **(Make Way for Tomorrow)**, and then have Steve\\'s \"I Want\" song **(Kid From Brooklyn)**, have him meet Erskine **(A Good Man)**, and get him recruited to Camp Leigh.\\nHave a quick song for Camp Leigh with Carter **(The Camp)**, super quick appearance by the Red Skull planning to send a spy to Europe, and then we get to the VitaRay scene **(Rebirth)**, which ends with Erskine\\'s sacrifice to stop a German spy from blowing up a New York city block.  **(A Good Man (Reprise))**\\nCut to Germany, and a big villain song with the Red Skull **(Cut Off One Head)**, and then Captain America goes to Europe to get revenge for Dr. Erskine **(Star Spangled Man With a Plan)**, and reunites with Bucky. No need to break him out. Steve confronts the Red Skull **(Two Sides of the Same Coin)**, but he gets away. A song with the Commandos **(Waa-Hoo)**, and another featuring the heroism of a specific Howling Commando (Jones?). Then the assault on the HYDRA Fortress with the Commandos and Carter, where Bucky sacrifices himself to save the Commandos **(To the End)**, Steve fights the Red Skull **(Tesseract Tango),** ending with Steve’s choice to brings the Valkyrie to a crash **(My Choice)**. However, right before the intermission, we are introduced to Agent Quartermain, a fictional character who will stand in for SHIELD, and bring Rogers back **(Rebirth (Reprise))**. \\n\\n\\n\\n# ACT II: Avenger\\nWe are introduced to the Avengers in the opening song of the second act **(Save the City)** as they defeat the Chitauri. This is an appropriate time to add a tribute to the first responders of New York, who are, as always, the real heroes **(The Real Heroes).** Feature Not-Sousa-Cop saving people’s lives.\\nWe then see Rogers lost at how much the world has changed **(Times Square Are a Changing)**, despite his fellow Avenger Tony Stark **(Tomorrow, Today)**, and Agent Quartermain **(Meet the New Dream, same as the Old)** trying to help him adapt. Rogers thinks he can\\'t make a difference anymore, that the world doesn\\'t need a super soldier anymore. After all, we have helicarriers now. Introduce Sam, who Cap still helps do &lt;something&gt;, and helps him in return **(Louisiana Hero)**.\\nWe meet Secretary Pierce controlling a brainwashed Bucky **(And Two More Shall Take Its Place)**. Captain America discovers their plot, and filled with new purpose (**Taking a Stand/Freedom’s Price),** comes in to rescues Bucky **(Never the End)**, stops the plot and start a new crusade against HYDRA. Also, Quartermain takes Carter and the controller’s place as the SHIELD agent who “takes a stand”. Rogers discovers that the new world is still filled with those who seek to end freedom, that those new methods of security are not that great, and he can still make a difference. \\n\\nTony Stark at this point also feels lost and unneeded. He feels like all heroes, Avengers or not, are no longer what they were, and convinces the government that they are no longer able to help **(SuperConsequentially)**. Basically, he’s lost faith in people, including himself. Captain America still believes in the ability of ordinary people to make a difference, and his own ability to make a difference, and so he clashes with Iron Man **(Step Up-Stand Down)** and then exits, with Iron Man shuttering the Avengers **(Nothing Lasts Forever/My Promise)**. \\n\\nYears later, after the Snap **(Those Lost Souls)**, with Quatermain having also been snapped, Captain America goes to see Iron Man, and talks with him about the original idea of the Avengers **(We All Made Promises)**, and reminding him of all the ordinary people who made a difference in the world who were inspired by them (Howling Commando featured above, Random Cop featured above, Quatermain, Bucky, Erskine) and that even though they might not save the world, they can sure as hell avenge it. Big Battle Song against Thanos **(Save The Day(Reprise)/I Can Do This All Day(Reprise))**, and Iron Man, inspired once more by Captain America, saves the day **(Make way for Tomorrow, Today)**. Of course, all details would be glossed over, as the details remain classified. Together with Bucky, Sam, and a returned Quatermain and the rest of the Avengers, a quiet reprise **(Never the End of the Line)**, where Rogers hands Wilson the SHIELD, and then go into a big final song combining all the big themes to round out the show **(Sentinel(s) of Liberty)**. \\n\\n---\\n\\nWhere Captain America is now is never explained, but it doesn\\'t matter, because his spirit, will, and power lives within every single person willing to do the right thing against evil. He believed in and inspired people like Erskine, Brainwashed Bucky, the Commandos, Quatermain, Not-Sousa-Cop, Tony, and that\\'s the main message of the musical. The Sentinel of Liberty is not Captain America. It\\'s ordinary, everyday people. And *that\\'s* what I think the message should be for a Captain America musical. \\n\\n---\\n\\nI\\'m a pretty big believer of strong musical thematic continuity, so this would have:\\n\\nA) Captain America\\'s main theme, \"I Can Do This All Day\"\\n\\nB) Captain America\\'s \"I Want\" theme, \"Kid from Brooklyn\"\\n\\nC) The Stark Theme: \"Make Way For Tomorrow, Today\"\\n\\nD) The Bucky Theme: \"Never the End Of the Line\"\\n\\nE) The Avengers Theme: \"Save The Day\"\\n\\nF) The HYDRA Theme: \"Tentacles Around the World/Cut off one head and two more shall take it\\'s place\"\\n\\nG) The Vow Theme - representing service: \"My Choice/My Promise/We All Made Promises\"\\n\\nH) The America Theme: \"The Dream/The New Dream\"\\n\\nAlso, despite the wordiness of Act II, it is indeed a balanced 18/18 song musical.',\n",

       " 'A lot of comics have portrayed the hate as rooted in what the mutants represent, namely the end of Homo Sapiens. Daredevil, Spider-Man, Captain America, Hulk for example were not born with their powers they were acquired through science, intentionally and unintentionally and do not pose a threat to the longevity of the human raise on an evolutionary level. Mutants on the other hand are the next step in evolution and there’s more and more mutants being born everyday causing the human raise to slowly be replaced. People will already have a natural fear, mistrust and hate for that, but when that’s coupled with government, church, cult and media leaders that stoke the flames with negative sentiment and fear mongering that hate will become amplified. \\n\\nWhen you look at what’s happening in the current X-men books the mutants have already claimed and formed their own nation, they’ve strong armed the other governments into giving them sovereignty, declared that all mutants shall be given pardons for their past crimes, they’ve claimed part of the moon and all of Mars and made themselves and their inner workings so isolated that the rest of the world don’t know what their planning. The optics of the situation aren’t good and make it look like they’re just waiting for humans to die or possibly planning to wipe them out all together after they consolidate enough power and a strong enough foothold in the world. In many peoples minds they’ve just validated every fear any human has ever had of them.

       " \"There's two big reasons, xenophobia and unpredictability.\\n\\nConventional heroes are easy to understand; Captain America was given super steroids, Iron Man is a rich guy with good tech, Hulk was a freak lab accident etc. etc.  Most heroes and villains have an identifiable origin, and something you can identify and understand is easier to accept or fight.\\n\\nMutants, however, just randomly appear.  Their powers manifest in young adults and teenagers, and are often wildly out of control.  You can't fight an enemy or control an asset if that enemy or asset can literally pop up out of nowhere.\\n\\nOn the xenophobic side, mutants are not the same as humans.  We are two different species that are now competing for resources in the same territory. Cro-magnons killed the neanderthals even though they could've co-existed, and that means mutants might kill humans or vice versa.

       " 'To go more in detail about something being referenced in a lot of these responses:\\n\\nStan Lee created X-men mutants to be an allegory for discrimination against minorities, and the characters are coded that way. The mutant powers track the markers of being different in a way that gets you mistreated in society, and the characters are written in a way that makes it obvious, i.e. Professor X is physically disabled but a powerful telepath; Mystique is a woman with a naturally ‘ugly’ body who can change her appearance to be whatever the world wants her to be, which allows her to gain power and acceptance, usually through some form of seduction, that she otherwise wouldn’t have based on her natural body; Darwin adapts to survive and is black, which implicates…the entire horrific history of American treatment of black people; Professor X and Magneto’s relationship was based off historical civil rights activists who fought to solve the same problem with conflicting ideological methods; the Sentinels were created to embody police brutality against racial minorities in the civil rights movement; the mutant cure tracks the eugenics movement, etc.\\n\\nBut it’s not the superpowers that make the X-men different from the Avengers, it’s that they’re coded as minorities. There are plenty of telepaths, shapeshifters, metalbenders, and adaptation powers out there, but the way the mutants’ powers are paired with their backstories, societal status, and the treatment they receive make it clear to the audience that the superpower is representative of their minority status, and the rest of the world is picking up on it.\\n\\nAnother important difference between the x-men and the Avengers is that mutants are born, the Avengers are made. This also tracks with minority status, because minority status is almost always born, and this feeds into systemic discrimination because a person can’t easily change their identity to avoid it, even if they wanted to. Mutants aren’t always aware of their born powers until a defining moment in their teens, which also tracks with member of minority groups discovering that part of their identity around that time (like with sexual orientation or gender identity), having their first defining moment where they realized that group is discriminated against (racial or ethnic religion minorities who leave a protected bubble or realize that the way they’ve been treated is because of racism for the first time), or having an accident that changes them from their birth identity forever (people with disabilities who have an accident or mental illnesses that develop in teenage years).\\n\\nBut the fact that mutants are born that way is disturbing for the public that discriminates against them because it means a) you can’t just fix it back to normal by pressuring people to conform to societal norms; b) the only way of getting rid of dangerous mutant powers is to destroy mutants, not just take away a powerful weapon or a high tech suit, so they feel much more out of control; c) mutants could come from anywhere in the population that has the gene, so it won’t always be the people they want to have power; and d) they or their kids could turn into mutants if they have that gene. And so the understanding is: mutants have freakish and dangerous power we didn’t want those people to have, and until mutants are wiped out, it could happen to anybody—even you or your kids. \\n\\nThe fact that mutants have powers that can actually be dangerous to the general public and do sometimes need to be controlled should distinguish their treatment from the treatment of minorities in reality, but it sadly, it doesn’t. Society in real life depicts minorities as being inherently more dangerous because of their minority status (the racist public widely accepts the idea that black people have guns, brown people are terrorists, inner city kids are into gang violence, immigrants are criminals, etc.). In effect, society in real life treats minorities as if they’re just as inherently dangerous as mutants who can destroy buildings and rewind time as random teenagers. Even though it makes no sense, the racist general public accepts that minorities are inherently more dangerous, and they fear those minorities in a way that white straight non disabled male Americans with power never experience, even when given physical power. (I.e. the NRA, cops, the military, professional athletes, who are widely accepted as legitimate and not feared, despite the statistics of how many crimes are committed by them as opposed to by minorities.)\\n\\nIn summary: the x-men aren’t discriminated against for their power alone, they’re hated and feared for the minority status they’re coded to represent. This stigma seems senseless when taken out of real life and hid as allegory in fiction, as many things are, because society accepts many senseless, backwards, and illogical things, but it’s hard to notice just how wrong it is until you transpose it into an allegory that strips away your conditioning to just accept it.\\n\\nConversely, the Avengers represent the establishment. Tony stark is the face of white male military industrial patriotic government controlled capitalism, and while he is recognized as being the bad boy, a core part of American culture is the suave white cowboy outlaw, and he’s just as American when he’s rolling into a congressional hearing blasting classic rock and flipping off senators. And Captain America is the face of the blond haired blue eyed Greatest Generation, who volunteered for the ultimate American dream, and was chosen specially and enhanced in its service. Forget needing propaganda to keep up his public opinion—Captain America is the origin of propaganda, the embodiment of its place in Western Society. Thor may be foreign and unAmerican in some ways, but he’s the embodiment of the white American roots going back to Celtic Europe, and modern American society holds that cultural heritage up with pride, believing themselves to be a cultural successor of its glory (that’s a longer tangent).\\n\\nWhile not all Avengers fit that mold of normal white establishment, those exceptions actually prove the rule. The members of the Avengers who aren’t the typical demographic receive wildly different treatment and public opinion when they’re in the context and under the protection of the group, than when they’re outside of it. Hulk before the avengers was hated by the public and hunted by the military industrial complex the moment they realized they couldn’t use him as part of their plans. When he’s within the Avengers, he both gains legitimacy and safety from being controlled by the establishment again, and has PR teams that spin his story closer to what is accepted by the public. Instead of a mutated subhuman threat, he’s portrayed as a white male genius who got his hands a little dirty in the process of achieving scientific breakthrough. Black Widow is hated and feared for her lethal aggression and competence except when she’s with the Avengers, wherein she’s accepted as a sexy femme fatale to stare at in an all male group. Hawkeye is canonically deaf in many versions of the Avengers, but that’s certainly never talked about by the public, even in stories where it’s cannon. \\n\\nIt’s also notable that NONE of the Avengers except Thor (the picture of white masculinity who’s powers most famously concentrate in his hammer) were born special—they were all born regular humans, and gained their special powers through situations relatively under their own control, explicitly to be used for the good of the public. Americans don’t look at them and see invasive freaks taking over, they see the establishment elevating particularly worthy individuals who volunteer to gain extraordinary powers in service of their existing ideals.\\n\\nIn summary, the difference between the X-men and the Avengers isn’t the superpowers, it’s the minority status the x-men represent.',\n",

Thor is a demigod, and therefore was never truly human in the first place. \\n\\nBut then you have Avengers who are treated with the same degree of scorn and distrust as mutants are. The Hulk is probably the best example. In a lot of ways, even though he is not a mutant, the Hulk resembles what the general public expects a mutant to be.

People get concerned that the mutants will push humanity to extinction whether they mean to or not and that drives people on edge\\n\\n2.

But this wasn’t true with mutants. Mutants are a general group with a very clear baseline establishing who’s on and who’s out. Plus majority of them aren’t heroes and some of them are actually villains so going after them and rallying voters against them is much more expedient\\n\\n5. At the end of the day, the X-men aren’t all that great in assimilating mutants with the rest of the world. They protect humans and talk about coexistence but their leader has on several occasions manipulated the minds of both allies and enemies. One of their core members was on multiple occasions possessed by a psychotic cosmic entity that eats stars.

       " 'MCU Earth, no matter what happens before Infinity War, has no logical reason to have any clue what Thanos is doing to where Superman could intercede beforehand. This is important to open with.\\n\\nLet\\'s say Clark is around but keeping his lower profile before Avengers, but has the suit ready to go. \\n\\nLoki attacks the Helicarrier and if Superman is there, there\\'s no way that Loki escapes and that means no Avengers, so lets assume he\\'s not on the Helicarrier. The Avengers have to avenge Coulson in the first place.\\n\\nSo Superman joins the team in NYC when all hell breaks loose. By this point the most likely meeting place is up on the Chrysler Building when Thor is nuking the first invasion wave, and then Superman would show up like he did in Justice League to kick surprise ass. Everyone would be quite pleased and I\\'m sure Nick probably literally calls Tony\\'s helmet here to say he trusts this guy as much as he does Stark, which for Tony is a glowing endorsement.\\n\\nSo add Superman to the circle shot. Natasha still has to shut down the portal cause not even Superman is moving that active system. It\\'s an Infinity Stone. Things otherwise go the same but faster. When the nuke comes in, Tony will still know first because Superman will be distracted and it\\'s JARVIS that detected it anyway. Superman almost certainly catches Tony instead of Hulk here and that\\'s a wrap on Avengers.\\n\\nUltron like you said never happens. I can\\'t see Superman going on every HYDRA raid but I can see him showing up for the big finale in the opening. No way Tony or Thor leaves anything to chance there. The party goes swimmingly but there\\'s no, full stop, NO possibility that Tony can resist trying to study the Scepter. \\n\\nI mean, let\\'s be completely serious here. There\\'s NO WAY he won\\'t.\\n\\nSuperman would make a quick appearance at best and then nope out to watch a movie with Lois, save an airplane, or go have late dinner in Kansas. He won\\'t sit around trying to lift the hammer.\\n\\nUltron\\'s coming either way, and that means we\\'re getting to at minimum South Africa. At this point they\\'re calling Superman in, but he\\'ll get owned by Wanda the same as anyone. There\\'s no way he\\'s not going to be frontline for something of this magnitude. He\\'d be right on the gangway along with everyone for \"he beat me by one second!\"\\n\\nClark has visions of Krypton\\'s destruction. Tony fights Hulk. Sad flight to the farm. Superman on the farm would be pretty awesome, especially when Laura asks him to lift heavy stuff. I want him driving fence posts into the ground single handed like he did in Smallville. That was hilarious. \\n\\nIf Superman goes to South Korea there\\'s no possible way at all the drones get away with the Cradle, so that\\'s boring, but that\\'s *exactly* where Superman would be. Nat is not captured and the Cradle is brought back to NYC same as before. Thor is off doing his vision quest with Eric. I think we get \"our\" Vision more or less the same.\\n\\nThat\\'s the thing here: the events up to this point are honestly sort of beyond the scope of intervention in \"material\" terms. I can\\'t see a lot of deviation.\\n\\nThis is where things seriously will go off the rails going forward.\\n\\nEveryone arrives to evacuate Sokovia and with Superman helping it goes *vastly* faster. The city will be nearly deserted by sunrise this time, even more so. \"All of you, against all of me\" is still happening, but once it gets to be Superman\\'s turn for a one on one with the vibranium Ultron, Superman will almost certainly not be able to by himself hurt Ultron. It took Thor, Tony and Vision to *begin* to melt him. Superman will cheerfully beat the shit out of him a bit and likely ding him up pretty good, but will get diverted to rescue people. Helicarrier arrives with Rhodey. Ultron is defeated. \\n\\n50/50 odds here that Superman with Thor and Tony can save the city somehow, but I doubt it. However, I bet you a lot that Superman can save a huge number of people on the ground from collateral damage and falling city pieces.\\n\\nHelmut Zemo\\'s family does not die and he\\'s ultimately reunited with them in a refugee camp. Zemo fades into history and obscurity. \\n\\nBruce still goes off as Hulk in the quinjet and ends up on Sakaar. Thor still goes searching for Infinity Stones. Ragnarok has already begun; it cannot be stopped. Odin dies. Hela returns and dies. Asgard will burn. \\n\\nWhen we get to Civil War, Nigeria will still happen. The registration act will still happen. The ceremony and signing happens in Germany with no issues or bombings. T\\'chaka does not die here. T\\'challa remains Prince and Black Panther. Peggy dies. Bucky is eventually found by Cap and others, and he\\'s clearly ready to be rehabilitated. Tony probably never finds out that Bucky murdered his parents. Steve wouldn\\'t figure it out here. Bucky may reveal this to Tony somehow later, but irrelevant for where we are.\\n\\nThe Avengers do not break up like a band, like the Beatles.\\n\\nThanos at this point is still going to \"do it myself\". He still will raid the Asgardian refugees. Half the remaining Asgardians will be murdered. Heimdall and Loki will die. Hulk will get lobbed back to Earth to warn that Thanos is coming.\\n\\nOne day, Tony is out jogging with Pepper in the park and Doctor Strange appears with Bruce. We\\'re into Infinity War now. The wobbles are about to get ridiculous. There is no way at all that Superman won\\'t be aware of a giant Space Donut hovering over and trashing Greenwich Village. He\\'ll fly by, see Tony and Bruce, and come in to land meeting Strange and Wong, so add him to the line up as Maw and Cull beam down to tell them to rejoice. Once the fight starts, we\\'re going to see Tony stomp forward and do the initial blasting and get flung into the air. \\n\\nSuperman is going to engage at this point, because he\\'s used to Tony randomly flinging himself into chaos and probably wanted to let him have his chance. Maw isn\\'t doing shit to Superman. Cull will swing that big thing at this face. Superman will catch it. Superman will punch Cull. Cull will fly away and land in Hudson Bay. This is about when Spider-Man will arrive, and at which point Strange, Wong and Superman absolutely will have the Children hilariously detained with magic while Superman shoves the Donut into a safer position out over the water. \\n\\nThere was no Civil War so there\\'s no reason whatsoever for Vision and Wanda to be in Scotland. They\\'ll be somewhere in the NYC vicinity, but likely at Avengers HQ upstate. It\\'s important to note that Captain America and T\\'challa have no relationship now. Kilmonger probably is still doing his US special forces work here and so Black Panther\\'s events don\\'t happen and Wakanda is still a secret place. It was T\\'chaka\\'s death that drew him out. Claw was absolutely caught by the Avengers and likely stolen back by now by the Dora Milaje so that avenue is closed to Kilmonger too.\\n\\nIf Vision is injured there\\'s no way out with Wakanda science so Infinity War will take place in New York state at the compound. Without Wakanda\\'s shields and security forces to back them up, the Avengers will be rapidly overran with fewer and fewer supporting staff and Avengers falling back... \\n\\n...except for Superman, and the fact that Strange and Wong will be present. If Vision hasn\\'t been hurt, it\\'s a total rout. Either way, Thor and Rocket are still coming, the Guardians were last seen on Knowhere, and neither Thanos nor Nebula has any reason to go to Titan. Thanos with the Space Stone knows exactly where the others are. Nebula tells the Guardians to head for Earth. So add the Guardians into the mix too. Inevitably, *everyone* will be there when Thanos finally arrives with the Power, Space, Mind, and Soul stones. Vision will still have Mind and Strange Time. \\n\\nThanos had only one cosmic-level threat in Wakanda: Thor. Now he\\'s got Thor, Strange *and goddamn Superman.* Strange will have the Time Stone hidden in another dimension here like before and not use his most powerful weapon until there\\'s no alternative. \\n\\nHonestly, Thanos is probably quite dead here. Thor is at the absolute pinnacle (so far) of his power and he\\'s out for blood and a good monologue. But it\\'s Superman. There\\'s no way for Thanos with the limits of the MCU stones/gauntlet to deal with him. Especially once Superman is aware of the scope of the threat, he\\'s going to rip that thing off Thanos\\'s arm faster than you can say excelsior, and Thanos will promptly get a fresh axe up his ass. Thanos is dead. Gamora is dead. A number of Avengers are probably dead. \\n\\nNo Snap happens. Wanda doesn\\'t go insane in New Jersey. That means Monica doesn\\'t get powers. Agatha probably eventually crosses paths with Wanda but not in the same way. Scott goes in and out of the quantum realm again without issue and Ghost is saved easily. Sam won\\'t become Captain America at this point, and the events of his side of the show are irrelevant anyway because so much was driven by the Snap. I could see Tony quietly helping his family with trivial costs (to Tony). Tony is going to retire here. His mission is over. He goes off with Pepper. Xandar is still decimated. Bruce/Hulk will end up with a different outcome now, as Professor Hulk was their response to Infinity War\\'s failures. Thor probably still leaves with the Guardians here for a time. \\n\\nThe surviving Avengers carry on. Superman finally formally joins the team. The Eternals don\\'t yet come out of hiding, but maybe they do, since the universe and Earth probably again came within moments of obliteration, and let\\'s be honest:\\n\\n*Someone* is snapping for *something*, because we expect *a* snap after all this trouble.\\n\\nProbably Superman, cause who else is surviving it?',\n",

And let's not forget that he can regenerate putting him in a cell that could contain him with just allow him to actually heal and get better. He isn't your average normal mass murderer from Earth, his physiology and everything is completely alien to us. We also have absolutely zero idea if forcing them to sleep with chemicals would even work. Or even execution by electricity, guns obviously don't work, so how would kill him. See how they're so many complexities here? If they decide to kill him for his crimes which is pretty obvious even if they can bring the people back, you stole 5 years of their life and destroyed their homes, their life, but even the family they left behind might have moved on causing extreme damage. I'm pretty positive Captain America would also not want him as a lab experiment because we know nothing about him they could spend 20 years trying to find a weapon that can actually kill him or a chemical that has a desired effect he would basically be a lab rat which is something that I don't believe Captain America would be down for either.

Not to mention that in current comic canon, (due to licensing rights it wasn\\'t in the movies) Cap\\'s shield is made of Vibranium, Adamantium, and one other unknown ingredient because the scientist fell asleep during the fusion process.

Even if you haven\\'t read the comics, we see evidence of this is the first Avengers movie.

If Logan was just in a blind rage, and not readily out to kill Cap, I believe Cap may be able to talk him down, maybe offer him a cigarette or a drink. \\n\\nNow, for Cap\\'s weaknesses against Wolverine:\\n\\n1. Cap may be a super soldier, but he\\'s still human. There\\'s only so much damage your body can take before it gives up because it just can\\'t heal you without reducing your lifespan to nearly nothing. \\n2. Cap\\'s heart.

He doesn\\'t really carry a gun, so it\\'s not exactly all that useful to him if all he can do is either have a shield or have a throwable weapon. \\n\\n\\nLogan\\'s strengths against Cap: \\n1. Healing Factor. Logan is basically immortal, only able to die if he\\'s essentially 100% vaporized, so we can assume Cap is only trying to incapacitate him, which means Cap will be holding back. \\n2. Logan\\'s fighting style. We know that Wolverine got his name from the way he fights, without relent, charging head-first into a sea of gunfire or whatnot. He may feel pain, but it heals instantly, so why would he pay attention to that pain? Logan also has the uncanny senses that alert him when someone/something is nearby. Most aignificantly, smell. He\\'d be able to smell Cap\\'s trail, easily being able to track him. \\n3. Claws. Adamantium is no joke. It\\'s one of, if not THE strongest material in the Marvel universe. These claws can rip through near-anything. Afaik, the only items which have resisted Adamantium claws are Asgardian metals and Proto-Adamantium. \\n\\nLogan\\'s weakness to Cap: \\n\\n1. If we assume that Wolverine is fighting whatever seems to be controlling his mind, if anything is, then Logan knows Cap, he\\'s a colleague, or an old co-worker, if not a friend. Logan will continuously fight whatever\\'s inside of him until he or it dies. \\n2. Cap is an incredibly good tactician, likely able to outwit Wolverine when the time counts. \\n3. Logan is short---just kidding (but really, he\\'s 5\\'8\") Logan may put on a tough exterior, bit like any human, he still has emotions. Triggering an emotional response could break him out of whatever faze he\\'s in.\\n\\n\\nFor the purposes of this exercise, I\\'m assuming that I essentially am Captain America, as in, I gain the skills/memories/relations Captain America would have while being hunted.',\n",

In the real world, the fictional X-Men as mutants represent as an analogy human equal rights of mutants, as to whether mutants are considered human or not, similar to how black people were once considered property and not human. The main reason the X-Men franchise was so popular was because they represented human rights and opposed bigotry. But in 2003, there is the legal case Toy Biz, Inc. v. United States. Basically, US tariffs stated there were two types of action figures for determining tariffs: dolls, which were \"human,\" and toys, which were \"nonhuman creatures\". Tariffs on dolls were higher than those on toys, Marvel Comics subsidiary Toy Biz argued before the U.S. Court of International Trade, that their action figures (including the X-Men and Fantastic Four) represented \"nonhuman creatures\" and were subject to the lower tariff rates for toys instead of the higher ones for dolls. The courts ruled in their favor, This decision effectively halved the tariff rate, from 12 percent tax to 6.8 percent, granting Toy Biz a lower tariff rate and reimbursement for import taxes on previous toys.

He lives a lonely life, detached from humanity save from when the world has need of him. \\n* His attempts to \"cure\" his condition grow increasingly desperate until the division between Hulk and Banner is pronounced to an absurd degree.

       " '&gt; This, it’s not that he’s “weak” to magic, but being that his powers aren’t supernatural at all, a supernatural attack would hurt him as much as anyone else.\\n\\ncc OP/posted at /u/rocketbot99 -- read this reply and upstream.\\n\\nThere\\'s a moment in the DCAU where Superman is getting lightning bolted in the chest by Captain Marvel/Shazam. This is magic lightning, that *burns* him. His Superman uniform is torn up and his chest blackened. He lives and heals obviously.\\n\\nThink of it this way:\\n\\nAll regular humans on all physical functions (brains too) range from 1-100 on everything. The fastest living human of all time, say Usain Bolt, is a 100/100 at this peak on \"sprinting speed\". The person with the best memory recall of all time is a 100/100 on memory recall; the person with the all time worst muscle strength is a 1/100 and so on. If you have the best bladder of all time, you piss with 100/100.\\n\\nCaptain America, Steve Rogers, is basically 100/100 on *everything*. Your typical human runs 50/100 on about everything.\\n\\nSo, where does Superman and magic fit in here?\\n\\nSuperman with no powers isn\\'t a 50/100, because he\\'s not human. He\\'s Kryptonian. Maybe he\\'s a 60/100 on average; it doesn\\'t matter. But, when he\\'s properly powered up?\\n\\nHe\\'s basically a 1,000,000/100 on *everything*, and then throw his iconic Super Powers on top of that. Hell, in some incarnations he\\'s probably a 100,000,000,000/100 on everything. \\n\\nWhat happens if you, me, Captain America, a de-powered Superman, and a powered Superman all get blasted by a bolt of natural lightning with 1.21 jigawatts of energy to transfer? We each get hit with the full bolt. ALL of us probably die except powered Superman, who is like, shit, I couldn\\'t save them because I can\\'t move faster than the speed of light. \\n\\nMaybe this bolt hurts him. Maybe it burns him. Then he rapidly regenerates, so he\\'s not hurt, or hell, maybe it just stuns him, or nothing. It varies. His powers and his massive physical 1 million out of 100 protects him. It all stacks on top of itself. It\\'s not just his muscles, but his bones, tendons, skin, fat, everything is amped up. Then you throw the powers on top of that! The lightning is a physical force hitting a physical object under normal rules of physics.\\n\\nWe still dead.\\n\\nNow, do the scenario over. This time, it\\'s a *magic* lightning bolt with the *same* properties otherwise, except it\\'s not a part of the physical world. It\\'s magic. It has its own physics.\\n\\nWe all get hit again. We dead. But powered up Superman... what we\\'ve seen is that magic often bypasses his \"powers\" which are generally separate from his *physical stature*. That\\'s why the Shazam lightning bolt didn\\'t just fucking murder Superman. \\n\\nIt might bypass his own rooted in funky DC Universe physics \"powers\" like his invulnerability, but it still has to *burn and injure him*, and he\\'s still built like an alien super-tank under the rest of his powers, and he still regenerates. So this lightning bolt, the outcome for *us* is the same, but now, he\\'s got a 1st degree burn, gets knocked on his ass, and by the time he hits the ground he\\'s healing and it\\'s half a first degree by the time his butt hits pavement... but then he\\'s zapped again on the ground and now it\\'s a 2nd degree, then a 3rd with the 3rd blast, and he\\'s healed to 2nd degree by the time #4 is coming in, and now he\\'s getting nerve damage that\\'s healing as fast as it can.\\n\\nYou or I are basically burned to smelly rendered fat with ashes flying about after magic lightning bolt #3. The outcome for us is the same if it\\'s natural lightning bolt #3 instead. That third magic lightning bolt... that\\'s the one that just started to *really* piss off Clark.\\n\\ntl;dr magic treats him as \"normal\" because he is normal under physics, but his normal is still ludicrously powerful.',\n",

I've constructed a headcanon that is more satisfying to me without contradicting them: \\n\\nSteve knew before he touched the hammer that he wasn’t going to lift it no matter what, because he knew doing so would damage Thor’s ego. The hammer recognized Steve as a potential wielder, so it moved slightly, but that decision, in that moment, made Steve unworthy. It’s something Steve does frequently: make decisions for his friends based on what he believes is best for them rather than allowing them to make those decisions for themselves. It is one of the central conflicts of Civil War. Steve learns in Winter Soldier that Howard and Maria Stark were murdered, and though he doesn’t say so explicitly, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to suggest that he eventually deduced that it was Bucky.  \\nThink about the lesson Odin is trying to teach Thor when he enchants the hammer. The inciting incident was Thor, acting of his own accord, starting a military conflict without considering the ramifications for his people. Odin wanted to teach him humility. That his instincts weren’t always right and that he needed to be more thoughtful about how his actions and decisions affected others. Steve’s unilateral decision to “protect” Tony from the truth ultimately caused significantly more damage than the truth would have. By the time Endgame arrives, Steve has learned his lesson. He didn’t trust Tony with the truth before. In 2012 New York, Tony literally asks him if trusts him now, and Steve says yes. That decision, that growth, makes him worthy when the final battle arrives.   \\nIs it a perfect theory? No. But it treats worthiness as something that is earned rather than given, which I think is significantly more appropriate. I mean, think about it, if Steve is worthy of this hammer of the gods so early in the story, does he really even have an arc? I would argue no. In fact, I think growing from an emotionally prude goody-two-shoes into a genuinely caring and trusting friend is his arc. He’d never admit it, but I think Steve feels sort of morally superior in the earlier movies. He basically says as much to Tony when he criticizes him for being a billionaire, genius, playboy, philanthropist in Avengers. But by Endgame, he’s accepted that Tony is his equal, that all of the Avengers are his equals, that the myth of Captain America doesn’t have to be the reality of Steve Rogers.

You would clearly design the hammer to just shoot its electricity and not try to copy the pattern from some source, as if that even makes sense. Amps are used for music because they copy what’s going in and exactly replicate it but just louder. If it did work as an amp then that means Captain America can create weak bolts of lightning and the hammer just copies that input signal and makes it more powerful.

Their understanding of the nature of the \"Sacred Timeline\" is at best incomplete, and at worst, a complete fabrication with only coincidentally coinciding information.\\n\\nAt the end of time in Loki, we do see what *appears* to be the Sacred Timeline and the Castle at the End of Time with He Who Remains at least aware of various incidences in multiple timelines, possibly multiple universes. We also see what appears to be the Sacred Timeline diverging once \"the threshold\" is reached.  This coincides with the readouts at the TVA in **an alternate *universe*.** (one where Mobius doesn\\'t recognize Loki-199999-B).\\n\\nHowever, no one\\'s version of how the omniverse works is credible. The TVA are brainwashed, the Loki\\'s are not trust worthy and ignorant of how these powers beyond them work, and He Who Remains is manipulative and quixotic.\\n\\nA single timeline spawning branches continuing into alternate universes, complete with Lokis being born different genders and species, as well as a TVA in which Mobius, an interchronographic Loki expert, doesn\\'t recognize Loki-199999-B, only makes sense if branches start at the beginning of time.\\n\\nWe know *a* quantum realm exists in a way that within it, a person can travel both back and forward in time. We know that messing with quantum time travel can accidently pass time through a person, rather than a person traveling through time. And we *know* that going back in time and making changes does not affect your native timeline, but that, at least with removing an infinity stone, one timeline can diverge from itself. (if you believe what the Ancient One tells Bruce)\\n\\nThe Ancient One also tells us there are multiple **dimensions**, and Dr. Strange traveling through them and Dormammu existing in one is good evidence that she was correct.\\n\\nWe have evidence that someone from one timeline can live a lifetime in an alternate timeline and then return to a point in his native timeline. (Captain America couldn\\'t have stayed in his native timeline to return the stones and hammer and then live his alternate life with Peggy, because you can\\'t change your own past)\\n\\nFinally, we have some conjecture and rumors about MoM and NWH, most notably that people from Earth-10005 or Earth-TRN688 are going to show up in Earth-199999 in NWH. (and Earth TRN688 already showed multiversal crossover in Into the Spider-Verse)\\n\\n*There\\'s other info on this subject that\\'s no longer canon to Earth-199999 like Agents of Shield in an unnamed \"Earth-ABC\", and Earth-616 has not had any crossover to Earth-199999, so we can\\'t use the comics as guidelines.*\\n\\nGiven what we know and what we think will happen, I\\'d say it\\'s reasonable to assume that \"alternate timeline\" seems to be synonymous with \"alternate universe\" only once the timeline branch passes \"the redline\". Before that, they are only \"alternate timeline branches\" and can be pruned. (the people directly pruned, go to \"the Void\" and the the rest of the timeline branch, spacetime fabric and all, get remerged into \"The Sacred Timeline\" via the use of \"time bombs\". Once a branch passes \"the red line\" it becomes an unpuneable alternate universe that can interact with Earth-199999 and cause a multiversal war. \\n\\nThe One Who Remains maintains this timeline through the TVA pruning branches to prevent alternate The One\\'s Who Remain from existing in a multiverse and waging interuniversal and chronographic warfare, but we know that other universes exist in the Marvel Multiverse, including those already mentioned, and that these universes can interact with each other.\\n\\nImportantly, branches can occur at any and all points in time once the timeline is no longer being maintained by The One Who Remains. So infinite branches starting from the beginning of the universe have formed. The TVA exists outside of time in its home universe, but not outside of its universe, and an alternate universe that must have branched and red-lined before Loki was born (965 AD) and Loki-199999-B was accidentally sent there instead of his native universe.\\n\\nThe quantum realm is either a bridge between the main timeline and alternate time branches (if the events of End Game were not big enough to redline either the past or present that can be remerged with the prime universe) or a bridge between universes that have not existed in the metaverse until **\"now\"**, but \"now\" that they exist, they have *always* existed.\\n\\n**tl;dr**\\n\\n**The Omniverse** includes Earth-1218 as well as all fictional universes and alternate histories, including all, canon and non-canon, Marvel universes.\\n\\n**The Metaverse** includes all Marvel and Marvel-connected universes; including canon and non-canon adaptations and media, the Fox Marvel Universe, the ABC Marvel Universe, The Sony Marvel Universe; all universes included in adaptations including Earth-1610, Earth-90214, etc.; and including Marvel properties like Malibu Comics universe, etc.; and including an Earth-1218 analogue. There are multiple Metaverses such as the DC Multiverse and the George Lucas Multiverse (Indiana Jones, Starwars, etc.)\\n\\n**The Multiverse** includes all Earth-199999 universes; including Phase I-∞ canon properties, and the alternate universes (unpruned timeline branches that became alternate universes after passing the redline in 2023, 2012, 2013, 2014A, 2014B, 1970A, and 1970B) The Avengers diverted off the main timeline in End Game. Multiple Multiverses exist within the Metaverse including the Earth-10005(Fox\\'s X-Men) multiverse and the Earth-TRN688(Sony\\'s Spider-man) multiverse. These multiverses may interact with each other as well as the universes within them.\\n\\n**Universes** are contiguous, coherent, and canon properties. Fox\\'s X-Men, X2, and X-Men: The Last Stand, along with the Wolverine trilogy are in one universe, but Fox\\'s X-Men: First Class, X-Men Days of Future Past*, and X-Men: Apocalypse are in another universe. Universes exist within a multiverse, but, like in the case of Days of Future Past and Deadpool 2, can interact with one another. We may see multiple multiverses as well as individual universes interacting in NWH (Maguire, Garfield, Holland), and very likely in MoM.\\n\\n**Timelines** are divergences from a main timeline in a universe,  but that are pruned before reaching the red line in variance. Loki-199999-B and Loki/Sylvie come from the same universe, but separate timelines/branches. The TVA also exists within its universe but not within a timeline. The main timeline of Earth-199999 is essentially all the MCU mainline movies as well as WV, F&amp;WS, and most of Loki.\\n\\n**Dimensions** are part of a timeline. Multiple \"dimensions\" exist both in the main timeline and in a branch, though it\\'s possible that dimensions are also on the same level as a timeline and are both not affected by timeline branches, and can be bridges to alternate timelines or universes, like the quantum realm does.',\n",

Gorman was put out there on his own, far from communication, far from resupply and support, and expected to make decisions he\\'s not qualified for.\\n\\n*Who* made that choice?

Some high ranking Marine deployment officer selected (or was directed  to select) a green Lt, despite a witness explaining the dangers of the creatures they were investigating *and* a complete nearly instant loss of communication with the colony.\\n\\nAt the very least they should have *also* had a Marine Medical Corps squad deployed to serve as a potential emergency hospital, and the Sulaco should have had a trauma center installed (with a doctor or two) in case there was some major accident, disease outbreak, or even serious radiation leakage.\\n\\nNo one *knew* what was going on, they just knew the Colony had stopped communicating and there were rumors of possible xenos on site. However a proper rescue party *should* have included medical staff for the colonists in case it *was* xenos and any were injured, let alone the myriad other ways of accidental injury or sickness that can befall distant colonial outposts.\\n\\nAnd even if it was just a downed transmitter, they didn\\'t bring any crew to repair it, just a single Artificial Human who could reprogram and do some minor repair work. There should have been a maintenance squad (if not a whole Maintenance *platoon*) to help get the communications system back online.\\n\\nThe mission was a shit show from the planning stages and we should address that as well. Why not a more experienced officer? Why no medical corps men? Why no trauma center? Why no maintenance team? Why did they not have \"soft\" rounds for exploring a civilian structure that potentially had survivors that could be killed or wounded by penetrating rounds?

We need to assume that A) &gt;!the TVA is okay with an alternate timeline existing for 70+ years (which is actually already potentially confirmed if Agents of SHIELD is still canon)!&lt;, B) &gt;!Cap never did anything in the past of this alternate timeline that changed things enough to trigger a red line Nexus event!&lt;, and C) Cap was able to use or reconfigure his watch to target the original timeline without using the Time Pad or creating a new branching timeline by time traveling to the original timeline\\'s present, OR Cap was able to return to the original timeline using the Time Pad but then sneak off without being seen somehow.\\n\\nOption 2: When Cap traveled back to 1948, he didn\\'t create an alternate timeline; he was always living in the original timeline\\'s 1948. &gt;!Both!&lt; Agents of SHIELD &gt;!and Loki!&lt; have now clarified that time traveling to the past doesn\\'t immediately throw you into an alternate timeline. It\\'s just alternate choices that are made in the past that create an alternate timeline branching off of the main timeline. &gt;!But time travel doesn\\'t necessarily create Nexus events;!&lt; sometimes time travel was supposed to happen, always happened, and fulfills the events of the past rather than altering them. Or sometimes it just doesn\\'t change them significantly enough to create an alternate timeline&gt;!/create a Nexus event!&lt;. (Agents of SHIELD tries to simplify this concept by calling it a \"ripples vs. waves\" phenomenon; as long as changes are small or non-existent (ripples) then an alternate timeline won\\'t form. If the changes are larger (waves), then one will.) So all of that to say that Steve always time traveled to the original 1948, and was always meant to live through that era. &gt;!This was part of the Sacred Timeline and therefore not an event subject to revision by the TVA.!&lt; Therefore an alternate timeline was never created, and he was able to get back to 2023 just by living through the years again, so he never had to time travel back to the present or the Time Pad.\\n\\nIn order for this option to work, however, we need for several assumptions to be true as well. We need to assume that A) Cap traveling to the past was something that always happened, and that he was always Peggy\\'s secret husband &gt;!and therefore the TVA had no issues with this as it was supposed to happen and part of the Sacred Timeline and therefore unable to create a Nexus event or alternate timeline!&lt;, and he and she decided to pretend he was someone that Captain America saved in WW2 as part of his new identity, and B) while in the past, Cap never did anything that would have put him on someone else\\'s radar who knew who he was, which means he sat out the events of every MCU film and show without helping unless he was able to do so off-screen without being noticed.\\n\\nOption 2 has fewer assumptions that need to be explained away, but the size of these assumptions is ultimately up to the viewers to decide at this time in deciding which option they prefer to believe.',\n",

It wasn’t until Steve saved the Hydra prisoners that we finally got what Erskine wanted, a hero. While Captain America is still technically a mascot, he is a hero and that’s the most important part of the title.\\nAfter Steve gave up the shield, the real fight of what’s wanted vs what’s needed began. Steve chose Sam Wilson to take the shield because he knows that Sam will do what is right. The American government chose John Walker because he fits what they think makes Captain America. Steve chose his replacement based on what was needed while government chose their replacement based on what they wanted.\\nSam did refuse the title at first but that was because he was afraid of not being able to live up to Steve’s legacy. So he gave the shield to the government to put in the museum hoping that would be enough of a symbol. However, the government disagreed and instead of telling Sam that they disagreed, they went behind his back and chose a new Captain America. Now John Walker didn’t want to replace Steve but he wasn’t chosen by the previous Captain to take the shield so that’s one reason people don’t like him.\\nAnother reason is that a hero is made based on what lies inside, not on what’s outside. Steve was chosen for the serum back in WWII because he was ready to do what is right. Even when they were trying to find the first Captain they had someone who looked like a good fit but when tested he hid like everyone else while Steve, the last person someone would expect to become Captain America, chose to sacrifice his life for others. Steve also worked with Sam and knew that he had the same morals and beliefs, so he wanted Sam to be the next Captain America. While John Walker may have shown the same morals and beliefs that Steve had, eventually his true colors were shown and we had a Captain America that didn’t live up to the legacy.\\nThe final reason, and I hate to say this, is image. John Walker fits the American Government’s image of Captain America while Sam Wilson does not. &gt;!Steve wasn’t the only person to get the serum back in the day. Many people tried to recreate it and failed but some managed to create new super soldiers. One of them was a black man named Isaiah Bradley. He was in a similar situation that Steve was once in when his fellow soldiers were captured by the enemy and he did the exact same thing Steve did. However, Steve was celebrated while Isaiah was condemned and arrested. Both super soldiers saved many lives, but one was named a hero while the other was named a criminal.!&lt; Basically, the government chose John Walker because he looked like the previous Captain and that was important to them. It’s stupid but that is the truth.\\nIn conclusion, having a new Captain America is not a bad thing but what is the bad thing is that John Walker was the Captain America the American Government wanted while Sam Wilson is the Captain America the world needs. Steve Rodgers chose Sam Wilson to be the next Captain America because he saw what the world had become and knew it was time for a different Captain. I know not many people are happy with the end of Steve’s story in the MCU but by living the life he thought was lost to him he saw how the world was before Thanos and knew it needed to go in a different direction.

Also the fact that neither bucky or wilson every ever gave him a shot to prove himself just pushing him down.\\n\\nA combination of the above along with the death of his friend, pressure and feelins of inadequacy of being captain america with no mental health support other than lamar makes him take the serum and subsequently it amplifies all of walkers best and worst traits.\\n\\nFunctionally speaking the super serum can never be given to anyone who is not a moral paragon otherwise you get your worst atributes amplified',\n",
       " \"Even Steve didn't want to be captain America sometimes. It was a tool for American imperialism, and they were just lucky that it happened to be Steve that had real global alien threats to fight against. But it's not going to do much to fix the world's refugee crisis or anything \\n\\nIn fact it seemed to be counter intuitive to have a captain America because it made it look like America was just pursuing its own interests, rather than trying to help everyone post-blip\",\n",
       " '&gt;it\\'s not really that unreasonable from Walkers perspective. \\n\\nI disagree. Saying, \"There is no Captain America without The Falcon, and you\\'ve been doing this longer than I have\" would\\'ve been humble and reasonable. Saying \"I could use some help from Captain America\\'s sidekick\" reduces Sam to just a relation to Captain America and implies that Walker has the authority to \\'requisition\\' Sam as the new Cap.',\n",
       " \"That's the thing. People _trust_ Captain America. What if it's not somebody worthy of trust?\",\n",
       " '&gt;The world is in shambles. Captain America is a name and role and symbol that people trust. It’s iconic.\\n\\nIs he?  Or is he a *person* that people love and trust? Do people have respect for the abstract title \"Captain America\", or do they have respect for *Steve Rodgers specifically*, the celebrity war hero who saved the world?\\n\\nBecause for most people, it\\'s probably the latter. Certainly, for Falcon and Bucky, it\\'s the latter\\n\\nEveryone loves Captain America, yes. But if you see Captain America as a specific person rather then a title, which is very much a plausible view, then it\\'s easy to see how people might see it as disrespectful to make a new one.\\n\\nTo a lot of people, it\\'s not passing on the title of Captain America, it\\'s looting the corpse of Steve Rogers.',\n",
       " \"Falcon gives up the shield because he feels it's Steve's. \\n\\nHe turns it in to the museum as part of Steve's legacy, but feels betrayed by the government who immediately turned around and gave it to someone else (without even asking Sam if he wanted to be Captain America, even though that's what Steve wanted)\\n\\nOver the course of the show, Sam recognizes the Shields importance as a symbol outside of Steve, and realizes how important it is that he wield it himself. \\n\\nA new captain america isn't a bad thing. The wrong people picking the wrong person for the role is a bad thing.\",\n",
       " '\\\\&gt;He probably would have gotten along well with Tony and Thor  \\n\\n\\nI think the first time he tried to pull rank as \"Captain America\" they would have lost all respect for him.  Every member of the Avengers I can think of has some problem with authority and is reflexively defiant towards anyone who tries to control them.  Tony and Thor in particular - Tony respects the hell out of Steve and still couldn\\'t stop giving him \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* , and Thor\\'s feelings for the authorities of earth can best be described as \"amused contempt\".  \\n\\nEven ignoring the whole \"You think you can fill Steve Rogers\\' shoes?\" issue, the Avengers aren\\'t going to embrace someone who is that impressed with his own importance.',\n",
       " \"&gt; Captain America is a name and role and symbol that people trust.\\n\\nAnswered your own question. The people trust Steve. They dont trust shit else. I doubt even Falcon would have gotten the ok if he had accepted.\\n\\nSteve had the best of PR. 1940's persona, punched Hitler, america's first super hero was everything we could have asked for back then.\\n\\nThen he went and got himself frozen and thawed out in the 2000s like a bad-ass, exactly like what the America of today asked for. From punching Hitler to punching Space Gods.  What isnt to love?\\n\\nNobody else has that. Iron Man was closest, but everyone knew what he was. Without Steve, the people would rather just the title die.\",\n",
